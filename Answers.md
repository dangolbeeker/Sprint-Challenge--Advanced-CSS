 1) What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Adaptive websites are specific sizes based on the viewport width. Responsive websites adjust throughout each pixel of the viewports width.

2)Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

In a Mobile First approach the page is originally and primarily designed for mobile screens and subsequent designs accommodate larger screens. Media breakpoints are typically designated with the min-width attribute.

In a Desktop First approach the page is originally and primarily designed for desktop screens and subsequent designs accommodate smaller screens. Media breakpoints are typically designated with the max-width attribute.

3)What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

This sets the 1rem to 10px.

4)How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is a tool for organizing and creating CSS. It provides
shortcuts for CSS commands without changing the behavior of the CSS.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? My favorite concept in preprocessing is nesting. It keeps my code so much cleaner and dryer. The concept that gives me the most trouble is parametric mixins. I have to go back to reference pages more often when using them and that slows me down.
